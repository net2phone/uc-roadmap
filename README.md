## 🗓 Quarterly milestones 

We have four major milestones every year. Every issue is scheduled to be released in one of these.
Q1 starts on August every year, so we can assign months into quarters.

| August | November  | February | May

| October | January | April | July

## 👩‍💻 uContact v6 releases

Currently uContact is on version 6 and new releases follow the 6 convention. 
For example after version 6.123 comes the version 6.124 an so on. 
Today all instances of uContact are in version 6.

## 🚀 uContact next releases

Until next version of uContact becomes stable, this will be released along with v6. Each new released of the next version will be called beta1, beta2, betaX. Once stable our plan is to migrate to version 7.
